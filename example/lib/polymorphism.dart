/// Example of using polymorphism.
///
/// Built Value classes and builders can implement interfaces and use mixins as
/// any other class.
///
/// One special case is if you want to `rebuild` instances via an interface.
/// Then, the interface needs to implement `Built`, but should not itself be
/// instantiated. You can do this by marking the class `instantiable: false`,
/// as here.
///
/// Very little code is generated for a non-instantiable Built Value; just the
/// interface for the builder. You can write this yourself if you prefer, then
/// nothing will be generated.
///
/// Note that dart2js has never supported implementing the same interface
/// with different generics, and in Dart 2 none of the runtimes supports it.
/// A correct fix for this is planned, but until then, the only way to make
/// this work is to omit the `Built` interface from the base type as done
/// here. See https://github.com/google/built_value.dart/issues/352
